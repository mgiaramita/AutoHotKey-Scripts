Script that will left click the mouse once every 4.5 seconds.

To activate press the middle mouse button and it will keep going until you press the same
button again.

Created so that I could view some photos without activating the fullscreen slideshow in the 
native windows image viewer.

To change the amount of time between clicks just edit the number next to the innermost loop
> loop, 45    Each loop sleeps for 100ms. You can do the math.

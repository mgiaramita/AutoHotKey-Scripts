Script to detect up and down mouse movements.
Can be used to input keys for video games or whatever you want.
Original idea was for using a mouse sensor as a beatmania turntable.

Down movements = 'a' key
Up movenemts = 'b' key

These can be changed eaisly in the script.

To start run the script and use the middle mouse button (click in scroll wheel) to toggle script on and off.
Make sure that the mouse is not at the top or bottom of the screen when you toggle the script. It won't work correctly.

WARNING: When script is active you cant move your mouse. The script gets the initial position and continuously moves it back there.
	 Toggle it on and off as needed.
